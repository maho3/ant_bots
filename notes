 - Design a system of evolutionary bots which fit some environment parameters
 - Environment parameters:
	- Need to eat to survive
	- Food placed randomly around banana trees
 - Input:
	- Cone of vision in front, input is angle from straight ahead
 - Output:
	- Left/right wheel power
 - Bot Parameters:
	- Stomach (0 to 1)
	- Position
	- Size
 - First see if I can get ants to follow food
 - Future work:
	- More complex input
	- Study cooperation/interaction (produce walls?)

 - End goal:
	- Interesting and dynamic simulation
	- Looks cool
